# Carcassonne: Lake Expansion

A fan-made expansion for Carcassonne introducing **lakes** as a new edge type.

## Overview

Lakes work like cities: lake edges must connect to other lake edges, and a lake scores when fully enclosed. But beware—incomplete lakes score **zero points**.

**New meeple:** Fisherman (works like a knight in a city)

---

## Scoring

| Condition | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Completed lake | 2 per tile + 1 per fish |
| Incomplete lake | 0 |
| Treasure Island bonus | Double total score |

### Examples

| Lake | Tiles | Fish | Score |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| Small | 3 | 2 | 8 |
| Medium | 5 | 4 | 14 |
| Large | 8 | 9 | 25 |
| Large + Treasure Island | 8 | 9 | 50 |

## Components

**25 tiles** featuring lake edges combined with roads, cities, and fields:

- 8 Caps (1 lake edge)
- 6 Corners (2 adjacent lake edges)
- 4 Straights (2 opposite lake edges)
- 3 T-Shapes (3 lake edges)
- 2 Open Water (4 lake edges)
