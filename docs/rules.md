# Carcassonne Lake Expansion — Full Rules

## Overview

A new edge type for Carcassonne featuring lakes that score like cities but with a fishing twist.

---

## Core Rules

### Lake Edges

Lake edges must connect to other lake edges, just like city walls must connect to city walls. A lake is **complete** when fully enclosed with no open lake edges.

### Meeple Placement

Place a **Fisherman** on a lake to claim it. The fisherman works exactly like a knight in a city:

- Only one fisherman can be placed on an unoccupied lake
- If two lakes merge, the player(s) with the most fishermen score the lake
- Ties result in all tied players scoring full points

### Scoring

| Condition | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Completed lake | 2 points per tile + 1 point per fish icon |
| Incomplete lake | 0 points |

This creates real tension—lakes are worthless if you can't close them, so there's risk in starting large ones and opportunity to sabotage opponents.

---

## Fish Icons

Some lake tiles have fish icons (1-3 fish) printed on them. Fish add bonus points when the lake is completed.

**Distribution principle:** Riskier tiles have more fish.

- Caps (easy to close): 0 fish
- Corners/Straights: 0-1 fish
- T-Shapes: 1-2 fish
- Open Water: 2-3 fish

---

## Special Tile: Treasure Island

**2 tiles in the set** feature a small island in the center of the lake.

**Effect:** When the lake is completed, **double the total score**.

### Stacking Rule

Only one doubling applies. If both Treasure Islands end up in the same lake, the second one just counts as a normal tile (no quadrupling).

### Treasure Island Design

Treasure Island tiles have 3-4 lake edges, making them committal. You can't easily close a lake containing a Treasure Island—you need to build big.

---

## Scoring Examples

### Example 1: Small Lake
- 3 tiles, 2 fish
- Score: (3 × 2) + 2 = **8 points**

### Example 2: Medium Lake
- 5 tiles, 4 fish
- Score: (5 × 2) + 4 = **14 points**

### Example 3: Large Lake
- 8 tiles, 9 fish
- Score: (8 × 2) + 9 = **25 points**

### Example 4: Large Lake with Treasure Island
- 8 tiles, 9 fish, 1 Treasure Island
- Base score: (8 × 2) + 9 = 25
- Doubled: **50 points**

### Example 5: Incomplete Lake
- Any size, any fish
- Score: **0 points**

## Interactions

### Lakes and Fields

Lakes interrupt fields, similar to rivers. A field on one side of a lake is separate from a field on the other side.

### Lakes and Roads

Roads can end at lakes (fishing villages) or pass alongside them. Roads on lake tiles work normally.

### Merging Lakes

When placing a tile that connects two separate lakes:

1. The lakes merge into one
2. Count all fishermen from both original lakes
3. Player(s) with the most fishermen will score when complete
4. If a lake contains multiple Treasure Islands, only one doubling applies

---

## Strategy Tips

1. **Small lakes are safe but low-scoring** — Easy to close but few fish
2. **Large lakes are risky** — High potential but opponents can sabotage
3. **Treasure Islands are targets** — Expect interference if you start one
4. **Caps are precious** — Save them for closing, not starting
5. **Watch for sabotage** — An incomplete lake scores zero; use this against opponents

---

## Compatibility

This expansion is designed to work with:

- Carcassonne base game (required)
- Inns & Cathedrals (lake equivalent of Inn could be added)
- Traders & Builders (fish work differently than trade goods)
- Most other expansions

---

## Design Notes

- Caps have no fish to discourage tiny safe lakes
- Fish increase with commitment (more lake edges = more risk = more fish)
- Treasure Islands require 3-4 lake edges, forcing ambitious play
- Enough caps and corners to close lakes reliably
- The 0-point incomplete rule creates tension and interaction
