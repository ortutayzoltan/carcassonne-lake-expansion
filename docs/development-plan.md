# Carcassonne Lake Expansion — Development Plan

A step-by-step guide to take this expansion from concept to finished product.

---

## Phase 1: Rules Refinement

### 1.1 Finalize Core Rules
- [ ] Decide how lakes interact with fields (do they interrupt fields like rivers?)
- [ ] Clarify what happens when two lakes merge with multiple fishermen
- [ ] Determine if fishermen can be placed on a single-tile lake
- [ ] Write clear rules for Treasure Island doubling (confirm no stacking)

### 1.2 Write Rulebook Draft
- [ ] Write 1-2 page rulebook in Carcassonne style
- [ ] Include illustrated examples of valid/invalid tile placements
- [ ] Add 2-3 scoring examples with diagrams
- [ ] Have someone unfamiliar with the concept read it for clarity

### 1.3 Edge Case Review
- [ ] What if a lake cannot be completed due to tile distribution?
- [ ] Can a single tile complete two separate lakes?
- [ ] How do lakes interact with other expansions (Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders)?

---

## Phase 2: Tile Design

### 2.1 Create Tile Specifications
- [ ] List all 25 tiles with exact edge configurations
- [ ] Assign fish counts to each tile
- [ ] Mark which tiles get duplicates (if any)
- [ ] Decide on tile back design (match base game or unique?)

### 2.2 Sketch Tile Layouts
- [ ] Draw rough sketches of each tile showing:
  - Lake edge positions
  - Road/city/field placement
  - Fish icon locations
  - Treasure island artwork placement
- [ ] Ensure visual consistency with base Carcassonne tiles

### 2.3 Digital Tile Design
- [ ] Choose design software (Illustrator, Inkscape, Photoshop)
- [ ] Source or create artwork:
  - Water/lake texture
  - Fish icons
  - Treasure island art
  - Shoreline transitions
- [ ] Design tiles at print resolution (300 DPI minimum)
- [ ] Match Carcassonne tile dimensions (45mm × 45mm standard)

### 2.4 Design Fisherman Meeple
- [ ] Sketch fisherman design (distinct from farmer, knight, thief, monk)
- [ ] Consider color (use player colors or unique blue?)
- [ ] Decide quantity per player (suggest 2-3 each)

---

## Phase 3: Prototyping

### 3.1 Paper Prototype
- [ ] Print tiles on cardstock at actual size
- [ ] Cut out by hand
- [ ] Use coins or tokens as temporary fishermen
- [ ] Use small beads or chips as fish markers (if needed for tracking)

### 3.2 Initial Solo Testing
- [ ] Play 3-5 solo games mixing lake tiles with base game
- [ ] Track how often lakes get completed vs. abandoned
- [ ] Note any tiles that feel too easy or too hard to place
- [ ] Record average lake sizes and scores

### 3.3 Identify Problems
- [ ] Are there enough caps to close lakes reliably?
- [ ] Is the fish distribution balanced?
- [ ] Do Treasure Islands feel rewarding or frustrating?
- [ ] Does the 0-point incomplete rule feel fair?

---

## Phase 4: Playtesting

### 4.1 Recruit Playtesters
- [ ] Find 4-8 people with Carcassonne experience
- [ ] Find 2-4 people new to Carcassonne
- [ ] Schedule 2-hour playtest sessions

### 4.2 Structured Playtesting
- [ ] Session 1: Base game + Lake Expansion only
- [ ] Session 2: Add Inns & Cathedrals
- [ ] Session 3: Add Traders & Builders
- [ ] Session 4: Full expansion mix

### 4.3 Collect Feedback
- [ ] Create feedback form covering:
  - Fun factor (1-10)
  - Clarity of rules (1-10)
  - Balance compared to cities (too weak / balanced / too strong)
  - Favorite and least favorite tiles
  - Suggested changes
- [ ] Take notes during play on confusion points
- [ ] Record final scores to check balance

### 4.4 Iterate
- [ ] Adjust fish distribution based on feedback
- [ ] Add or remove tiles if needed
- [ ] Revise rules for clarity
- [ ] Repeat playtesting until stable

## Phase 5: Production Design

### 5.1 Final Artwork
- [ ] Commission or create professional tile artwork
- [ ] Ensure style matches official Carcassonne aesthetic
- [ ] Design box art and logo
- [ ] Create final rulebook layout with professional formatting

### 5.2 Component Specifications
- [ ] Tiles: 45mm × 45mm, 2mm chipboard with linen finish
- [ ] Fisherman meeples: 16mm tall, wood or plastic
- [ ] Rulebook: folded booklet, color printed
- [ ] Box: tuck box or small square box

### 5.3 Print-Ready Files
- [ ] Export tiles as print-ready PDF with bleed
- [ ] Create meeple specification sheet for manufacturer
- [ ] Prepare rulebook as print-ready PDF

---

## Phase 6: Manufacturing Options

### 6.1 Personal Use / Gifting
- [ ] Print tiles at home or local print shop on thick cardstock
- [ ] Use blank wooden meeples and paint them
- [ ] Hand-cut tiles or use paper cutter
- [ ] Estimated cost: $10-20

### 6.2 Print-on-Demand (Small Batch)
- [ ] Use services like The Game Crafter, Make Playing Cards, or PrinterStudio
- [ ] Upload tile designs and order chipboard tiles
- [ ] Order custom meeples or use standard tokens
- [ ] Estimated cost: $25-40 per copy

### 6.3 Professional Manufacturing (Large Batch)
- [ ] Contact board game manufacturers (Panda Game Manufacturing, LongPack Games, etc.)
- [ ] Request quotes for 500-1000+ unit runs
- [ ] Expect MOQ (minimum order quantity) of 500-1500 units
- [ ] Estimated cost: $5-10 per copy at scale

---

## Phase 7: Distribution

### 7.1 Personal / Fan Project
- [ ] Share print-and-play files on BoardGameGeek
- [ ] Post on r/Carcassonne and r/boardgames
- [ ] Create a page on itch.io for downloads
- [ ] Note: Cannot sell due to copyright

### 7.2 Official Licensing (Long Shot)
- [ ] Contact Hans im Glück (original publisher) or Z-Man Games (English publisher)
- [ ] Prepare pitch document with:
  - Rules summary
  - Tile designs
  - Playtest results
  - Why it fits the Carcassonne family
- [ ] Be prepared for rejection or long wait times

### 7.3 Retheme as Original Game
- [ ] If pursuing commercial release, retheme to avoid IP issues
- [ ] Change lakes to something original (crystal caves, lava flows, cloud formations)
- [ ] Create unique art and branding
- [ ] Publish independently or pitch to publishers

## AI-Assisted Tile Design

### Image Generation Tools

**Midjourney / DALL-E / Stable Diffusion**
- Generate lake water textures, shorelines, fish icons
- Example prompt: *"top-down view of a medieval lake shoreline, Carcassonne board game style, flat illustration, no perspective"*
- Challenge: Consistency across 25 tiles requires careful prompting

**Workflow**
1. Generate base assets (water texture, shorelines, fish icons)
2. Manually assemble in Photoshop/Illustrator/Canva
3. Create template with edge zones
4. Drag and drop to build each tile

### Template-Based Automation

Define tiles programmatically and script assembly:

```json
{
  "tile": "corner_1",
  "edges": {
    "top": "field",
    "right": "lake", 
    "bottom": "lake",
    "left": "field"
  },
  "fish": 0,
  "special": null
}
```

Tools: Python + Pillow, or Figma with plugins

### Fastest Path to Prototype

1. Generate one good water texture with AI
2. Use existing Carcassonne tile scans for roads/cities/fields (personal use only)
3. Composite in Canva (fast and free)
4. Use AI for fish icons and treasure island art

This approach gets you playtest-ready in hours rather than days.
